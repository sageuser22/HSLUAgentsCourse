Title: Rural STEM Lab Initiative

Our nonprofit plans to create a small STEM learning lab in Pine Valley, a rural community with limited access to technology. The lab will offer weekly hands-on workshops in robotics, coding, and basic engineering for middle and high school students.

Goals:
- Reach 100 local students within the first year.
- Improve STEM engagement and career readiness.
- Partner with schools and local businesses to sustain programming.

Expected Impact:
Students will gain practical problem-solving experience, exposure to STEM careers, and access to modern tools that rural schools currently lack.
