Project Title: Community Solar & Resilience Hubs (CSRH)

Renew Together will install two solar-powered community resilience hubs in Detroitâ€™s low-income East Side neighborhoods. Each hub will provide clean energy to essential facilities like cooling centers and food pantries while training residents in solar maintenance. The project will reduce emissions by about 150 metric tons annually and cut utility costs by 25%. Over 18 months, it will engage local partners to install systems, host energy workshops, and ensure community-led operations. By combining renewable energy, workforce training, and neighborhood ownership, CSRH strengthens climate resilience and equity for over 3,000 residents.
