        "CSRH will install two community solar + battery resilience hubs on Detroit’s East Side at essential-service sites (a cooling center and a food pantry) to provide clean power daily and life-sustaining services during grid outages.",
        "The project delivers measurable impact: an estimated 150 tCO2e/year reduced, average 25% electricity bill savings for host sites, and uninterrupted access to cooling, device charging, refrigeration, and communications during emergencies.",
        "An 18-month, shovel-ready workplan covers community co-design, engineering, interconnection, procurement, installation, commissioning, and a pilot operations phase with workforce training for local residents.",
        "Community ownership and governance will ensure long-term financial sustainability, reinvest savings locally, and build trust through transparent decision-making and shared benefits.",
        "A strong coalition—facility partners, a community-based organization, an experienced solar+storage developer, workforce/evaluation partners, and utility/city coordination—will de-risk delivery and scale lessons citywide."

        "Detroit’s East Side faces high energy burdens, frequent outages, and heat/cold stress that disproportionately impact low-income households, seniors, medically vulnerable residents, and people relying on refrigeration for food and medications.",
        "Essential-service sites—cooling centers and food pantries—are trusted, accessible anchors that already serve residents daily and become critical lifelines during extreme weather and grid disruptions.",
        "Current gaps include limited backup power, insufficient cooling capacity during heat emergencies, and rising utility costs that constrain service hours and program offerings at community facilities.",
        "CSRH beneficiaries include facility clients, nearby households within walking distance, and staff/volunteers; co-benefits include safer spaces during emergencies, device charging, cold storage for perishables and medicines, and reduced pollution exposure.",
        "The project was shaped with community input gathered through listening sessions, surveys, and partner meetings, ensuring culturally responsive services, convenient hours, and clear communication channels before, during, and after emergencies."

        "Solution: Two behind-the-meter solar PV arrays with battery storage and islandable microgrid controls at a cooling center and a food pantry, providing daily bill savings and resilient power for critical loads during outages.",
        "Scope of work: site assessments and load profiling; community co-design workshops; engineering and interconnection applications; permitting; procurement (PV, batteries, inverters, switchgear, EMS); construction; commissioning; staff training; and initial O&M.",
        "18-month timeline with milestones: Months 1–3 engagement, needs assessment, and site control confirmation; Months 4–6 design, permitting, and interconnection submittals; Months 7–12 procurement and installation; Months 10–14 workforce training and mock drills; Months 13–15 commissioning and handover; Months 12–18 pilot operations and evaluation.",
        "Resilience operations: pre-identified critical circuits (cooling, lights, refrigeration, device charging, communications), load-shed strategies, and islanding protocols integrated with emergency response plans and public communications.",
        "Community ownership and governance: formation of a community advisory group, pathway to community ownership (e.g., cooperative or trust structure), transparent benefit-sharing policies, and host-site agreements specifying public access during emergencies.",
        "Workforce development: paid training in solar, storage, and O&M for local residents, with safety certifications and hands-on hours during installation and the first year of operations; clear pathways to placements with contractor partners.",
        "Risk management: early utility coordination to de-risk interconnection; permit pre-application meetings; contingency for supply-chain delays and change orders; insurance, warranties, cybersecurity for EMS, and a funded O&M reserve.",
        "Scalability and replication: standardized designs, open-source playbooks for community engagement and resilience operations, and data-sharing with city and regional partners to inform future hub deployments."
