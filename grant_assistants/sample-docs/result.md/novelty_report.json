    "Detroit Community Resilience Hub Initiative (EcoWorks + Michigan Interfaith Power & Light): EPA Community Change Grant selection to convert ~20 houses of worship/food assistance facilities into solar-powered resilience hubs with EVs as backup. Track I award ~$20M.",
    "Eastside Community Network’s Resilient Eastside Initiative (Detroit): Pilot network of resilience hubs with solar + battery (e.g., Stoudamire Wellness Hub, Brilliant Detroit Chandler Park, new Lenox Center/AB Ford Park); backed by Kresge, GM Climate Equity Fund, USDN, and others.",
    "City of Detroit “Solar Neighborhoods” program (with Lightstar/DTE): 165 acres of solar to power 127 municipal buildings; large-scale community-benefit framing but city-led.",
    "Groundswell community-owned resilience hubs (Atlanta/Baltimore): Faith/community facilities with solar+storage, IRA direct pay and philanthropic support (GM Climate Equity Fund, Wells Fargo); explicit emphasis on community ownership.",

  ],
  "key_differentiators": [
    "Two-site, essential-service focus on Detroit’s East Side (cooling centers/food pantries) with community ownership and resident-led operations, positioning as a depth-over-scale complement to existing city- or network-led efforts.",
    "Integrated, paid workforce training pipeline tied to O&M and career placement (modeled on Solar Works–style programs) with guaranteed local hire targets; builds durable local capacity rather than one-off installs.",
    "Quantified outcomes aligned to funder expectations: an 18‑month delivery window; transparent CO2e accounting using EPA eGRID marginal factors; and bill-savings framed consistently with community solar programs (e.g., 25% total-bill savings where 50% supply discounts apply)."
  ],
  "summary": "This concept is directionally aligned with many active efforts in Detroit and across the U.S. Community solar–powered resilience hubs sited at trusted facilities, coupled with workforce pathways, are well-trodden. In Detroit, the Eastside network and a new EPA-funded multi-hub initiative are already moving. The novelty here is moderate: a tightly scoped, community-owned, two-site pilot at essential-service locations with an explicit workforce/O&M pipeline and clearly calculated emissions/bill-savings targets. To stand out with funders, emphasize community governance, paid apprenticeships tied to hub operations, IRA direct pay/low‑income bonus stacking, and integration with Detroit’s existing hub networks rather than duplicating them.",
