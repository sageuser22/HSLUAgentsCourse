## Clean Power and Resilience for Detroit's East Side

Community Solar & Resilience Hubs (CSRH) will build two solar+storage resilience hubs on Detroit's East Side: one at a cooling center and one at a food pantry. The hubs deliver clean daily power and keep critical services running during outages. Each year, CSRH will avoid 150 tCO2e, cut host facility bills by 25%, and serve 3,000+ residents. The project is shovel-ready with an 18-month schedule from community engagement and design through installation, commissioning, and pilot O&M. Community governance and shared ownership anchor long-term sustainability and trust, while paid local training builds a resilient workforce. A strong coalition—facility operators, neighborhood leaders, technical and workforce partners, and city/utility allies—will co-lead delivery. CSRH advances Community Climate Action Microgrants goals by reducing GHGs and strengthening resilience for low-income residents through community-led planning, ownership, and benefits.

## Reliable Power for Health and Safety on Detroit’s East Side

On Detroit’s East Side, many households face high utility costs, frequent power outages, and extreme heat and cold. Seniors, people who use medical devices, and families who rely on refrigeration bear the brunt. Residents tell us they lose food and medicines, endure unsafe indoor temperatures, and lack places to charge phones or get updates. Our community’s trusted anchors—the cooling center and food pantry—serve as first stops for help. They lack reliable backup power, and rising utility bills force cutbacks in hours and services.

Primary beneficiaries include clients of the cooling center and pantry, nearby households within walking distance, and the staff and volunteers who keep the doors open. During emergencies, these sites will offer safe, cooled or heated rooms; device charging; refrigeration for food and medicines; and access to information and communications. By reducing use of portable generators, the project will also lower exposure to air and noise pollution during outages.

Through listening sessions and short surveys, residents set priorities: extend evening and weekend hours during heat waves and cold snaps; reserve fridge space for insulin, baby formula, and WIC foods; send updates by text and posted flyers; and welcome anyone from the immediate neighborhood. We will continue to gather feedback and adjust hours and services to meet changing needs.

## Islandable Solar+Storage at a Cooling Center and Food Pantry

We will design and build two behind-the-meter solar PV and battery energy storage systems with seamless islanding—one at the City Cooling Center and one at the Community Food Pantry—to lower daily utility costs and power critical loads during grid outages.

Scope. We will: (1) complete site assessments and load profiling to define PV sizing, battery capacity, and critical circuits; (2) run co-design workshops with host staff, community users, and first responders; (3) advance engineering and utility interconnection applications; (4) obtain permits; (5) procure PV modules, batteries, inverters, switchgear, and an energy management system (EMS); (6) construct and integrate systems; (7) commission to UL/IEEE standards; (8) train staff; and (9) provide initial operations and maintenance (O&M) during a pilot period.

Timeline (18 months). Months 1–3: engagement, site control, data logging, and co-design. Months 4–6: detailed design, interconnection review, and permit submittals. Months 7–12: procurement and installation of PV, batteries, inverters, switchgear, and EMS; utility protection settings. Months 10–14: staff training, tabletop exercises, and onsite drills. Months 13–15: testing, commissioning, and handover. Months 12–18: pilot operations, performance monitoring, and evaluation.

Resilience operations. We will hardwire critical circuits: cooling-zone HVAC, lights and receptacles in refuge areas, refrigeration at the pantry, communications, and security. The EMS will implement staged load-shed based on battery state-of-charge and PV output, prioritizing life-safety loads first, then refrigeration, then comfort cooling. Islanding will be automatic via certified transfer equipment; black-start procedures and manual override will be documented and drilled. Emergency communications will include posted on-site procedures, radio/phone trees with city emergency management, and EMS dashboards accessible to authorized staff.

Governance and ownership. A community advisory group will guide design tradeoffs, resilience activation triggers, and public access protocols. We will execute benefit-sharing agreements that specify use of bill savings for community services and O&M. Host-site public access agreements will define hours, spaces, and staffing for heat events and outages.

Workforce development. The project will fund paid training tied to industry-recognized certifications (e.g., OSHA-10, NABCEP entry-level) and supervised hands-on hours during installation and commissioning. We will coordinate placement pathways with local contractors and apprenticeship programs.

Risk management. We will hold pre-application meetings with the utility and permitting authorities; maintain approved alternates for key equipment to manage supply-chain risk; require manufacturer warranties; implement EMS cybersecurity (network segmentation, MFA, role-based access); and establish an O&M reserve to sustain performance.

Scalability. We will standardize designs across both sites, publish open-source playbooks (SOWs, single-line diagrams, EMS logic), and share anonymized performance data and islanding event reports to support replication.

## Clear metrics, verified data, and adaptive learning

We will track and report outcomes across five domains with defined metrics and verified sources, supported by quarterly reporting and continuous learning.

- Environmental (Data: EMS, utility bills): 150 tCO2e/yr avoided; kWh generated; battery throughput (MWh cycled); diesel generator hours avoided.
- Resilience (Data: EMS logs, incident reports): hours of critical load coverage; residents served during emergencies; cooling/refrigeration uptime; drills executed.
- Economic (Data: utility bills, host financials): 25% average bill savings for hosts; dollars and percent of savings reinvested in services and staffed hours.
- Workforce (Data: training rosters, LMS, partner reports): trainees enrolled; training hours completed; certifications earned; job placement and 6-/12-month retention; participation by priority populations.
- Equity and engagement (Data: governance minutes, enrollment lists, surveys, outreach logs, ADA checklists, grievance tracker): governance participation; community ownership enrollment; survey response rate and favorability; multilingual outreach reach; ADA checks completed; grievance intake, resolution time, and closure rate.

Evaluation approach: We will publish quarterly dashboards, pursue a learning agenda (e.g., drivers of resilience per dollar and equity impacts), and apply course corrections to dispatch settings, outreach, and training based on findings.

## Integrated team and committed partners

Our team integrates accountable leadership, community governance, and technical delivery. The lead applicant oversees project management, compliance, and funder reporting. A community-based organization co-chairs engagement, steers community governance, and codesigns benefit-sharing mechanisms. Facility partners—a cooling center and a food pantry—provide host sites, formalize public access commitments, and implement operations protocols to ensure safe, reliable service. Technical partners include an EPC/developer to deliver design-build, an electrical engineer of record to stamp designs and interconnection, and an EMS/controls provider to configure, commission, and maintain controls and data reporting. Workforce and evaluation partners deliver training, certifications, and job placement, while an independent monitoring and evaluation firm tracks outcomes and learning. Readiness: Site control letters are in progress; utility interconnection pre-application is initiated; the permitting path with authorities having jurisdiction is identified; and a community steering group is established.

## Cost allocation, leverage, and value

We will apply funds to critical project and program costs while holding indirects ≤10%. Example allocation for a $75,000 request (indirect = $5,250; 7%):

Project costs:
- Design & interconnection: $8,000
- Equipment (PV, batteries, inverters, switchgear): $30,000
- Installation: $12,000
- Permitting/inspections: $2,500
- Commissioning: $3,000

Programmatic costs:
- Community engagement: $3,500
- Resilience planning/drills: $2,500
- Workforce training (stipends + instruction): $5,000
- MEL (monitoring, evaluation, learning): $2,000
- O&M reserve: $1,250

Leverage: We will stack federal incentives (e.g., IRA ITC and bonus adders, where eligible), utility rebates, and vendor/municipal programs, and seek a philanthropic match to extend equipment spend; rebates reduce net capex and O&M.

Cost-effectiveness: Daily bill savings from PV and battery dispatch, avoided outage losses via resilient backup, and paid training pathways deliver near-term and long-term value. Community ownership and governance keep savings circulating locally to fund O&M and future upgrades.

## Shared power, inclusive access, transparent benefit

Community-led design: A Resident Advisory Group of East Side residents co-decides priorities, budgets, and hiring. We reserve seats for youth, elders, renters, and small business owners. Members receive stipends and childcare. The group meets monthly and can call special sessions.

Inclusive benefits: We provide no-cost emergency access, multilingual outreach and signage in the top local languages, ADA-compliant sites and materials, and culturally responsive programs co-facilitated with trusted partners.

Economic inclusion: We prioritize East Side hires, post jobs locally first, and offer paid training and apprenticeships. We build pathways for underemployed and justice-impacted residents in partnership with reentry groups. We remove barriers through ban-the-box hiring, flexible schedules, and transit stipends.

Ownership and governance: We will create community shares or a community trust that holds a stake and votes on priorities. We publish benefit allocation criteria, dedicate a share of net surplus to the trust, and release annual public impact and finance reports.

Accountability: We maintain multiple feedback channels, a clear grievance process with a 10-business-day response, and annual equity audits with public findings to adjust delivery.
