Project Title: Southside Solar Microgrid Pilot

Organization: Neighborhood Energy Commons (501(c)(3))

Idea Summary:
We will deploy a 120 kW rooftop/parking‑lot solar + 300 kWh battery microgrid across three affordable housing buildings in the Southside district, reducing tenant electricity bills ~25% and keeping a cooling center operational during outages. The project will train and hire local residents for installation and provide bilingual workshops on energy savings.

Fit Notes:
- U.S. nonprofit; work located in qualifying low‑income census tracts
- Direct, near‑term emissions reduction and resilience benefits
- 12‑month timeline with city housing authority and a workforce nonprofit partner
- Budget request: $65,000 (≤ 10% indirect)
- Clear community co-design and equity plan
