Project Title: LuxeChain — NFT Art Marketplace for Elite Collectors

Organization: LuxeChain Labs, Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp)

Idea Summary:
We will launch a premium NFT marketplace with concierge services for blue‑chip art collectors, integrating dynamic pricing and token‑gated events. Initial focus is on international HNWIs and museum partners. Revenue from listing fees and drops.

Fit Notes:
- For‑profit focus; no nonprofit sponsor
- No climate mitigation or resilience outcomes
- Primary beneficiaries are high‑income collectors, not low‑income residents
- Global scope; not U.S.-community implementation
- Budget primarily for marketing and influencer partnerships
